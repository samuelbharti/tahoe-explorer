# Guided product tours (cicerone).
#
# A click-through demo that walks a first-time user across a page's key
# controls. One tour per page; the navbar "Demo" button (see server.R) starts
# the tour for whichever tab is active. Each step targets a page module's
# namespaced element ids -- the `tour_*` anchors added in the module UIs.
#
# tahoe_tours() maps a page id (the register_page id / navbar value) to a
# zero-arg builder returning a cicerone::Cicerone guide. server.R builds and
# initialises each once per session.

# Small helper: a Cicerone guide from a list of step lists. Each step is
# list(el, title, description, position); `el` is the raw (un-#'d) element id.
